# Bowtie++ deployment example

This configuration can be used as a deployment example with containers. It uses a revserse proxy to serve both the API and the static web resources.

## Installation
Create the .env file and place it at `backend/app/app` and `backend/app/user`.
From the project root, launch `docker-compose up`. It may take a few minutes for the containers to be launched.
